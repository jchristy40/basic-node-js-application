Gennett hasn't gotten what he considers a fair offer for his services on the open market this year. The 30-year-old made the All-Star team two years ago with the Cincinnati Reds when he hit .310 (second in the league) with 23 home runs and 93 RBI. It all went downhill when he injured his groin in spring training last year, sidelining him for three months. Gennett returned too early from his injury and hit just .217 in 21 games before being traded to the Giants. He was released by San Francisco after only 21 games. He was expecting offers in the $5 million range this offseason, but the best he got was for $1.5 million and $500,000 in incentives. Unless Gennett unexpectedly receives a better offer with guaranteed money, it sounds like he's unlikely to return to the big leagues.]]></content:encoded>

The Jets expect to eventually sign Adams to a lucrative contract that will make him a "Jet for life." However, Adams' camp is frustrated with the pace of recent talks and would like an extension before the 2020 season. The All-Pro safety is entering the final year of his four-year, $22.2 million rookie deal and wants his money now, but the team's brass wants to wait. The Jets say they haven't had any trade talks involving Adams since the trade deadline last October. Adams is refusing to take part in the team's "virtual" offseason program, and it's unknown if he plans for a holdout when training camps begin. But the Jets hold all the leverage, as Adams is signed through 2021 at a cost of $9.86 million and they have the option of the franchise tag twice beyond that. With the coronavirus pandemic also creating future financial concerns, the Jets would prefer to hold off on an extension.]]></content:encoded>

Peterson has rushed for 1,940 yards and 12 touchdowns in his two seasons in D.C. and missed just one game when he was a healthy inactive. The future Hall of Famer will still have a role in 2020, but he's likely to be overshadowed by Guice and/or Gibson.]]></content:encoded>

If a long-term deal isn't reached by July 15, Prescott will have to play on the franchise tag ($31.4 million) through the 2020 season. The Cowboys currently have an offer out to Prescott that would make him the second-highest paid NFL QB in terms of average per year, according to sources. Not only did Prescott have a career year in 2019, but he now has a receiver trio of <a class="rbPlayer nfl" href="https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/16765/Amari+Cooper">Amari  Cooper</a>, <a class="rbPlayer nfl" href="https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/19867/Michael+Gallup">Michael  Gallup</a> and impressive rookie <a class="rbPlayer nfl" href="https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/21679/CeeDee+Lamb">CeeDee  Lamb</a>, not to mention one of the best running backs in the league in <a class="rbPlayer nfl" href="https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/17923/Ezekiel+Elliott">Ezekiel  Elliott</a>.

"You're getting a version that we all expect that he will be at. He's back," Smith-Schuster said. "He's doing what he's doing. He's throwing NFL passes, there's nothing more to that." Smith-Schuster had an extremely disappointing season with injuries mixed in, but it was mainly due to the fact that Big Ben wasn't on the field throwing him passes. When Roethlisberger's return, the entire Steelers offense should rebound if he can stay healthy. There's obvious risk with the 38-year-old QB, but if he is fully past his arm issues and stays on the field, he'll be a great value pick as a late-round QB2.]]></content:encoded>

After five seasons with the Rams, which included a 21-touchdown campaign in 2018, the former All-Pro was released after being plagued with consistent knee issues. While questions regarding Gurley's health seemingly should have been answered after he signed a one-year deal with Atlanta back in March, offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter indicated that he isn't sure exactly how healthy he is. "The main question no one seems to know is, what's his health status? What's his workload?" remarked Koetter recently on "The Dirty Birds Podcast." While the team may know more once they see the 25-year-old in action during practices, it isn't promising news for those expecting a productive fantasy season out of the former Georgia Bulldog in 2020.]]></content:encoded>

With the organization selecting former Georgia tackle Andrew Thomas with the fourth overall pick, the protective unit has been touted by Pro Football Focus as one of the most improved lines in the league. Barkley will enter 2020 looking to rebound from a subpar 2019 season that saw the 23-year-old regress in statistical categories across the board. While a high-ankle sprain was also a factor in his second-year decline, an improvement on the blocking end will surely help his case to finish as the year's top fantasy back.]]></content:encoded>

However, he is still slotted by most to finish as the top back once again in 2020, especially when you consider the team's strength of schedule. McCaffrey ended 2019 with 287 carries for 1,387 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. He also added 116 catches for another four scores and 1,005 receiving yards.

Tensions are raised between the team and their star safety. Both sides have had multiple conversations since the NFL draft, but the Jets told Adams they'd prefer to wait on a long-term extension and Adams wants a deal before the 2020 season. The Adams camp claims the Jets are dragging their feet, and the possibility of a trade came up in talks between the two sides on Wednesday. The Jets are intent on keeping the 24-year-old and have no desire to trade him, however, but Adams is open to a trade if his contract demands aren't met. More than half the teams in the league have reached out to New York to express interest in Adams. He's due to make $3.5 million this year and his salary jumps to $9.9 million in 2021, the amount of his fifth-year option. We don't know how this will turn out, but Gang Green's defense is much better with Adams in the fold. Since 2011, only 16 of 223 first-round picks have received a new contract after their third season. Adams was an All-Pro last year and has made two Pro Bowls in his first three seasons. He's likely looking to become the league's highest-paid safety.]]></content:encoded>

Both sides would love it if Mahomes remained a Chief for his entire career. He's currently set to count around $5.3 million against the salary cap in 2020 on the fourth year of his rookie deal, but the expectation is that he'll sign a long-term extension and become the highest-paid player in the NFL. The 24-year-old was the MVP in 2018 and led the Chiefs to a Super Bowl title last season. Mahomes' 2019 regular season wasn't nearly as good as his 2018 campaign, but he remains in consideration to be the first QB off the board in fantasy drafts alongside <a class="rbPlayer nfl" href="https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl/player/19781/Lamar+Jackson">Lamar  Jackson</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Appearing in a conference call with the media on Thursday, Donald not-so-subtly showed off how his offseason workouts have gone by featuring a shirtless background photo of him flexing like he's being featured in a muscle magazine. He also reassured the media members that even though the team is adopting a new defensive scheme this year, he's still going to be well-prepared for combat. While Donald's words and impressive presence can puts minds at ease, it doesn't change the fact that there are 10 other guys on defense with him who will be learning a new scheme as well. Whether that scheme will take the league by storm or get stormed remains to be seen. It's hard not to like any scheme that has No. 99 at the center of it though.]]></content:encoded>
